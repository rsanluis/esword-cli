Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages were English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Traditional Chinese, and Russian.[11] The languages were chosen because they represented most of humanity, except for Hebrew, which was chosen because of its connections to Judaism and Christianity.[11] According to the monument's sponsors, the inscriptions are meant to guide humanity to conserve nature after a nuclear war, which the creators thought was an imminent threat.[11][13] The inscriptions dealt with four main themes: \"governance and the establishment of a world government, population and reproduction control, the environment and humankind's relationship to nature, and spirituality.\"[2]\n\nThe inscription read:[2][23]\n\n1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\n2. Guide reproduction wisely \u2013 improving fitness and diversity.\n3. Unite humanity with a living new language.\n4.
