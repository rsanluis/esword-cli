    // Lazarus in the End Times represents the certain (group of Men) that is currently sick,
    // dead in sleep, or metaphorically asleep in the truth while awake.

    // Notice that the verse starts at John 11:1
    //   and at the conclusion of      John 11:35

    // John 11:35  Jesus wept. 
    //
    // 1) Jesus stated in John 10:30, I and the Father are one.
    //    If God and Jesus are one, then Jesus definitely knows the future.
    //    a) For example, when he flipped the tables of the money changers he knew
    //      that money in the future will be an issue of the future; take for instance
    //      the notion of a cashless society and programmable currency
    //      
    //      Jesus Cleanses the Temple
    //      Mathew 21:12  And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought
    //      in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of
    //      those who sold pigeons. 
    //      Mathew 21:13  He said to them, 
    //      “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’
    //      but you make it a den of robbers.” 

    // 2) Jesus knew that from John 11:1 to John 11:35, that this pattern of (35) elapsed
    //    would be found tragic 11/1 event will be fulfilled in the future.
