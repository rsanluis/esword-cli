    // Event 09/30/2007 - September 30th, 2007 - The Four Horsemen meet in Washington, D.C.
    //
    // On 30 September 2007, Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and Dennett met at Hitchens' residence
    // in Washington, D.C., for a private two-hour unmoderated round table discussion. 
    // The event was videotaped and titled "The Four Horsemen". During "The God Debate" in 
    // 2010 with Hitchens versus Dinesh D'Souza, the group was collectively referred to 
    // as the "Four Horsemen of the Non-Apocalypse", an allusion to the biblical Four Horsemen
    // of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelation. The four have been described as 
    // "evangelical atheists".

    // The "Apocalypse" commencement starts with the arrival of the Four Horsemen.
    // Although the Word of Man states that they are not the horsemen from the Apocalypse,
    // the Word of God does indeed point to this very day as a significant event in the 
    // Revelations Timeline.
    // 
    // Revelation 9:18-19
    // Rev 9:18  By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke,
    //   and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. 
    // Rev 9:19  For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their 
    //   tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. 
    // The important keywords to extract from Revelation 6:2-8, 9:1-19 based on the context
    // of all verses are: HORSES, MEN, HORSEMEN
    // 
    // By these three was the third part of men killed 
    // By these three - since we extracted the root context word HORSEMEN from
    // Revelation 9:1-18, The Bible is inferring to the 3 horsemen
