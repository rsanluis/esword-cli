    // Revelation 18:21  And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, 
    // and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city 
    // Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
    
    
    // Mat 24:37  But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 
    // Mat 24:38  For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 
    // Mat 24:39  And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 
    // Mat 24:40  Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 
    // Mat 24:41  Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 
    // Mat 24:42  Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 

    // The key to finding out what will happen is to be watchful and alert as Jesus said in 
    // Matthew 24:42

    // Luk 6:48  He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.
