    // Revelation 18:21  And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, 
    // and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city 
    // Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
    
    // Rev 18:2  And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen,
    // is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and
    // a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. 

    // *** Flood/water event ***   
    // Matthew 24:37  But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 
    // Matthew 24:38  For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 
    // Matthew 24:39  And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 
    // Matthew 24:40  Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 
    // Matthew 24:41  Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 
    // Matthew 24:42  Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 

    // *** Rain fire and brimstone ***
    // Luke 17:28  Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought,
    //   they sold, they planted, they builded; 
    // Luke 17:29  But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven,
    // and destroyed them all. 
    //
    // *** Water event ***
    // Matthew 18:6  But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better
    // for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 

    // *** Go up to the mountain and build your house to glorify God ***
    // Hagai 1:8  Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, 
    //   and I will be glorified, saith the LORD. 
    // Hagai 2:6  For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens,
    //   and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; 
    // Hagai 2:7  And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill 
    //   this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts. 

    // Build Your House on the Rock
    // Mat 7:24  Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a 
    //   wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 
    // Mat 7:25  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house;
    //   and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. 
    // Mat 7:26  And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto 
    //   a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 
    // Mat 7:27  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; 
    //   and it fell: and great was the fall of it. 

    // Luk 6:48  He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. 

    // Daniel 9:26  And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself:
    // and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the
    // end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.

    // Jeremiah 51:42  The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.

    // Jeremiah 51:55  Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves 
    // do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:

    // Isaiah 5:30  And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: 
    //   and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is 
    //   darkened in the heavens thereof.
