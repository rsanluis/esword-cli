Revelation 13:15  
  And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast
  should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast 
  should be killed.

Daniel 3
1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and
  the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province 
  of Babylon.  
6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst 
  of a burning fiery furnace.
