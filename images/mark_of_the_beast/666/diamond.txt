Ezekiel 28:13 
Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone
was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, 
and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the 
workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day 
that thou wast created.

Note: Notice the 3rd stone was made from diamond.


Jeremiah 17:1
The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond:
it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;

Ezekiel 3:9 As an (adamant H8068) harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.

(adamant H8068) - shâmı̂yr; shaw-meer' - From H8104 in the original sense of pricking; 
  a thorn; also (from its keenness for scratching) a gem, probably the diamond: -
  adamant (stone), brier, diamond.
