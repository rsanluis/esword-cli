But instead in programs you count 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2 and so on.
So year 1 BC is mathematically 0, 2 BC is mathematically -1 and so on.
A generic year "N" BC must be computed and entered as "-N+1"!
As an example the year 1000 BC must be entered as -999!

To obtain 3 BC, we need to enter it into Stellerium as: -N+1

So 3 BC is -3+1 which is -2 as we see in the provided image.
